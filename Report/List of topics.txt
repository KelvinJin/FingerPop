1. Background Survey
	1a. The problems.
		a. The Game format 
		b. concurrency in the Game through multi threading
		c. Mutual Exclusion in the game
		d. Deadlocks in the game

	1c. The algorithms we went over
		a. Mutual Exlcusion
			1. Token Manager
			2. Central Server Algorithm
			3. Few generic algorithms
			
		b. Concurrency
			1. Server lock
			2. Timeouts (for avoiding deadlocks)
			3. few other generic algorithms 

2. Comparitive analysis:

	2a. What we were looking for in an algoeithm
		a. Solve Mutual Exclusion and concurrency efficiently without much overhead
		
	2b. Table / Paragraphs of algorithms we chose and how they compare with each other
